    "A stack of books placed on a table follows the LIFO order. If we add a new book to the top of the stack, it will become the first one to be removed when someone needs a book.

This way, the last can added is the first to be removed, which follows the stack principle.\n",

    "Bounded stack: :A stack limited to a fixed number of items, meaning it can only hold a certain number of elements. A regular stack as we know it can grow dynamically if implemented with resizable data structure like a linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular Queue: In linear queue, insertion is done from the rear end, and deletion is done from the front end. In circular queue, the insertion and deletion can take place from any end. A circular queue is more memory efficient because, in array implementation, it reuses the empty space produced due to dequeued elements\n",

    "Write pseudocode or explain how a queue can be implemented using an array or a linked list:\n",
    "For implementing the queue in an array, we only need to keep track of two variables: front and size. The front points to the first element in the queue, and size keeps track of the number of elements. When we enqueue an item, we insert it at the position front + size and then increment the size. For dequeuing, we check if the queue is empty and remove the item at the front. After removal, we shift all remaining elements to the left by one position. We then decrease the size to reflect\n",
