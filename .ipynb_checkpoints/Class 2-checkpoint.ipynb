    "\n",
    "Circular Queue: In linear queue, insertion is done from the rear end, and deletion is done from the front end. In circular queue, the insertion and deletion can take place from any end.

For dequeuing, we check if the queue is empty and remove the item at the front. After removal, we shift all remaining elements to the left by one position. We then decrease the size to reflect\n",
